# Horse Betting Project
Project for Applied Programming at Karlstad University.

The program resulted in a user-based horse racing model. 
In this model, the user selects parameters from a predefined list and assigns weights to the selected parameters. 
The model is then tested against real horse racing data, and it provides the opportunity to test various bankroll management methods. 
Throughout the project, skills were primarily developed in data cleaning and handling using Python. 
Additionally, some knowledge was gained in working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB, R, and basic statistical concepts.
